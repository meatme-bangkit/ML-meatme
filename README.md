This repository used for image processing and creating model detection for MeatMe. We use dataset from kaggle then we built model using CNN method. At the end of the model, we will transform the model to tflite.

# Workflow
Search Image Dataset -> Image Preprocessing -> Creating Model Detection -> Convert to TFLite -> Deploy to Android
